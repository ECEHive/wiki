This webpage will tell you everything you need to know about fablight laser cutter.

A fiber laser cutter is a focused beam of infrared down to .005" which will cut through metal. With a high pressure nozzle, the metal will be cut and blown away. The laser is pulsed which means the laser is not continuous but will output higher power when it is on. The machine is only suitable for metal, as wood and plastics will absorb the laser. However, most typical metals can be cut with ease such as Aluminum, and various types of steels. We have had folks try copper, brass and bronze as well. The machine is able to cut and engrave.

## Technical Specs

For specific technical specifications, you may visit the manufacturer's [website](https://www.3dfablight.com/laser-cutting-machines)

> Note: As of mid-2024, the manufacturer (3D Fablight) has suspended their operations. Many of their official resources may be unavailable.

The dimensions of the cutter are 40"x74"x60".

The accuracy of the machine can be as +/-.002" per foot with kerfs being +/-.005" per foot.

For the most common materials, here are the maximum depths given:

| Material | Maximum Depth (in.) | Maximum Depth (mm) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mild Steel | .250" | 6.35mm |
| Stainless Steel | .188" | 4.78mm |
| Aluminum | .188" | 4.78mm |

## Standard Operating Procedures and Quick facts

### Introduction

This SOP is meant to include all information necessary for standard operation as well as an introduction to maintenance. The team at FabLight provided multiple documents on the use of the machine, software, and plugin; this document will include the majority of that information while focusing on the tool’s usage in our space.

FabLight’s first party documents can be found here: [website](https://3dfablight.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/33000221174-manuals)

If in the future any of this information becomes outdated or if you have any possible improvements, I encourage you to make the revisions so that we can all learn from one another.

The current revision of this SOP will not explain the usage of the SolidWorks plugin. It is my goal to add this in the future.

### Video Guides

There are complementary YouTube videos which walks through the basics of safety and usage:
