## Premise

During this workshop people will be creating wooden bookends with lightbulbs.

## Logistics
Capacity: 5

Volunteers requested
- Please note for both Machine Shop workshops (this one and the paper towel one) this semster we want all the Machine Shop MPIs present since they are new, so we want to use this as a training opportunity to get us all on the same page for future workshops/semesters. We have four MPIs so no volunteers are needed other than a photographer if that is something wanted by staff.

Location: 1st floor, machine shop

For the lightbulb mount I am going to try to see if the dimmamble one is mountable so only order one of those for now, and if it is we can order more, and if not we can use the more basic ones.

## Post-Workshop Notes

Number of Participants: 5
- Good due to high level of supervision needed and limited machinery

Premise of the workshop: A bookend with an Edison lightbulb

What went well: Each MPI was buddies with an end user so it was a good walkthrough

What would you change: More time to rehearse with Mpis. I got materials super late so not a lot of time for prep.
