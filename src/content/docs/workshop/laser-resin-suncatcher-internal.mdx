## Workshop Overview, In Brief
Resin stained glass (not glass) workshop. Still working on a good name lol. Maybe laser-cut suncatcher workshop?

We make a guide on how to make your own design and work illustrator/inkscape (drawing paths, offset, union). We then cut the design in wood + spray paint to give it a metallic look. Then fill it in with resin :)


## Workshop Overview, In Medium

This workshop involves making "stained glass" window decorations via laser cutting and resin pouring. This will allow you to make some intricate shapes – no glass cutting skills needed :)

The frame and skeleton of the window decoration is created via laser cutting the material (wood or metal). Covering one side of the wooden frame with resin tape forms a mold on which we pour the resin.

To better understand the concept, here are two videos demonstrating the process.

Before the workshop, PIs will have to prepare templates for laser cutting – 5 is a good number. If desired, participants can find and select their own line art to make stained resin out of. Pis holding the workshop should be able to guide participants through the scaling and image tracing process.

After laser cutting, participants will spray paint the design their desired color for the frame. Both the spray paint booth and laser cutting room should be staffed at all times.

Afterwards, it is time to fold the mold with resin. Cure it with UV light, and all set.

*Do not discard the supplies after use, as we can find a way to reuse them. Use acetone to clean off resin if needed!*

## Before the Workshop

In the RSVP form, include an option to submit a description or a link to an image of what they are interested in making. If time permits, we can prepare additional templates to match their submissions. We'll try to accommodate and make ~5 templates that are ready to laser cut. Definitely include a design that features Buzz!

Additionally, provide a choice for whether a participant would want to make their own template with our guidance at the day of the workshop. In the interest of speed, all templates are limited in size to approximately half of the standard wooden boards the Hive keeps in stock.

Prepare kits ahead of time (in interest of sustainability, consider making wax paper origami boxes!). Each person will be provided with approx. 5 additional mixing cups, sticks, pipettes, and gloves. Optionally add suction cups and chains as well for the final product.

Mix resin beforehand and provide participants with a palette of colors that they can further adjust the intensity of if desired. Mix the resin <u>slowly</u> to minimize the presence of air bubbles. When using mica powder, <u>advise participants to use it sparingly</u>, as small amounts go a long way.


Have things set up on all the tables for the day of
- Circular room table w/ resin tape and plastic film backing
- ~Laser cutting~ circular room table w/ resin cups and kits and mats
- Painting room table w/ spray paints and places to dry + heat gun

**To upload existing designs. Amanda W has them.**

##  Detailed Instructions

<Steps>
1. Have 2 PI volunteers in addition to the workshop host(s)
    1. One for laser cutting, one for paint booth, maybe one extra volunteer that can help with illustrator
2. On the day of the workshop, participants gather on the first-floor circular room.
3. Participants who are good to go with choosing one of our templates can start laser cutting right away.
    1. One PI will be stationed at the laser cutters and adjust to optimal settings.
4. While waiting for their turn to laser cut, people can adjust our provided designs or create a template using line art they have found themselves.
    1. The circular lobby outside the Production Studio is a good place with table space for laptops.
    2. PIs proficient in Illustrator serve as a guide through this process.
    3. Line art weight should be adjusted to approx. 1/16” for sturdiness.
    4. Include attachment points for hangers if desired in the final product.
5. After finishing laser cutting, lead the participants to the spray paint booth. The paint will need to dry before proceeding to the next step.
    1. Bring a heat gun to help speed up drying
    2. Thin coats dry much faster. Apply multiple thin coats rather than one heavy coat
6. After the frame is fully dry, the next step is to pour resin. Before pouring resin, cover one side of the frame with resin molding tape*.
    1. Cut a piece of plastic film to place underneath, for additional support
7. Provide each person with their kit. They may mix their own resin in addition to the provided colors.
    1. Advise to mix the resin slowly to minimize air bubbles
    2. Use mica powder sparingly, as a little goes a long way.
    3. Use small paint brushes to gently scoop the powder into the resin. Use wooden popsicle sticks to mix the resin itself.
8. Done pouring? Time to cure the resin. Small designs can go inside the curing station and will be ready within 10 minutes. Larger designs can be left in the sunlight for 2-4 hours to cure.
    1. It can be helpful to cure the resin as you pour, to minimize the leakage across sections. Depends on availability of UV flashlights.
9. For the finishing steps, peel off the backing resin tape. Participants have the option to measure and attach small chains and fasteners to their design. Enough suction cups will be provided for everyone to get at least one. Woohoo, all set!
</Steps>

**Masking tape can be used in place of resin molding tape. However, masking tape does not peel off as nicely when used as a resin mold.*

## Notes for Future Iterations
- Purchase resin curing station, relying less on UV flashlights
  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGV2JJ9J
- This would also be an awesome workshop for the Fablight!
  - Consider using aluminum for the frame, which can be ordered from https://www.mcmaster.com/
- Nice to have canvas drop cloth to better manage resin spills
- Meet in the circular room! Laser cutting room is noisy
  - Bring the portable display down?
- Try out using alcohol ink to color the resin
  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HJVSD5S/
  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082G557CR/
- Denser wood will help with preventing leakage
  - Would be neat to have fancier wood (https://www.dickblick.com/items/ampersand-hardbord-pack-5-x-7-x-18-pkg-of-3/ )
- Used disposable 1 oz mixing cups for the first iteration of the workshop. Moved away from in interest of sustainability
