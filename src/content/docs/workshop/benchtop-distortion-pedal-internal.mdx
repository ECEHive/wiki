:::note

**Semester**: Spring 2025

**Peer Instructors**: Toni Rabisheva

:::

Number of Participants: 10
- Yes, I think it was because it's a lot of content to get through in just 2 hours, and it requires participants with some background knowledge in circuits.

Premise of the workshop
- The final product was a fully soldered PCB, as well as validation of the PCB!

What went well
- The number of volunteers was really good for helping everyone chug along. The slides were apparently really informative - people were interested. 

What would you change
- Potentially splitting up the workshops into 2 sessions, ordering the correct components and fabing a board to make sure it works before the workshop, or really enforcing that participants who sign up know what they're doing.
