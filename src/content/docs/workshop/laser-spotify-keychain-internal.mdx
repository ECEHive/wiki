## Premise
This cute workshop invites couples or close friends to come as pairs and create matching keychains together. Each pair will choose a song that is meaningful to them, and the Spotify code for that song will be engraved on their keychains. The keychains will be approximately 0.5” x 3” each, and will interlock to form a heart when placed together.

## Logistics
Capacity: 20 people, 10 pairs

Volunteers requested:  3 volunteers, familiar with laser cutting and illustrator. Each volunteer can help two pairs

## Post-Workshop Feedback

Number of Participants: 15
- Good! the longer part was when we actually got downstairs, bc some people didn't properly vectorize their images which prolonged the process for everyone—still, we think allowing for up to 15 signups is a good number

Premise of the workshop
- Each pair edited an Adobe Illustrator template file to engrave the Spotify code of a song meaningful to them, also customizing the fronts and backs as desired. The keychains were 0.75" x 3" each, and form a heart shape when placed together.

What went well
- The Adobe Illustrator part went fine, there was a short live demo of how to use Illustrator—plus we (workshop leaders) and volunteers went around helping people so that went smoothly.

What would you change
- We had pairs who finished early wait until everyone else was done, and then we broke up into 2 groups to go down & do the engravings. Instead, as soon as a pair or two was done, we should've sent a volunteer down with them to laser cut their keychains so they could leave early if they wanted. One of the reasons why we didn't do this was we forgot to explain/demonstrate to volunteers before/at the beginning of the workshop how to do this.
