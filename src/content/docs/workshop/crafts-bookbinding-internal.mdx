## Host Feedback Post Workshop

### Technical and Logistical Obstacles

"The volunteers helping didn’t have previous experience with the book binding procedure and were unable to help effectively.

Coordinating a two-part workshop is difficult because attendees are not always available for the next workshop."


### Suggestions for Future Iterations

"I would allow more time to learn basic arts and crafts skills. Many people did not know how to use x-acto knives, T-Squares, or basics rules of arts and crafts. I think giving more time for those fundamentals would help."
