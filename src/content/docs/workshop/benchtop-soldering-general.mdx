Each semester, the Hive offers multiple soldering workshops introducing beginners to basic soldering technique. Soldering is used to build electronics by attaching circuit components to a [PCB](/guides/pcb-basics) with a conductive metal "glue" called *solder*. The solder is starts as a solid and is available in spools. A heated metal wand (*soldering iron*) is used to melt it in a controlled manner. When the solder cools, it hardens, creating both a physical and electrical connection between circuit components.

Soldering is an important skill for anyone interested in making electronics. At each workshop, you will learn the basic principles of soldering and important safety procedures. Then, you will have the opportunity to practice soldering using the kits provided at the workshop. Peer instructors (PIs) will be there to help you and answer any questions. The practice kit is yours to keep, and if you don't finish during the workshop hours, you may come back to the Hive at any time during open hours. You do not need to have any experience or do any preparation beforehand to attend a soldering workshop.

Unable to attend a workshop? Stop by and ask a PI to teach you. Know how to solder but would like to improve your skills? Soldering practice kits are readily available at the front desk. Simply ask the PIs on shift for a kit and a key to a workstation drawer. *Note that Hive policy requires end users to wear safety glasses while soldering.*
