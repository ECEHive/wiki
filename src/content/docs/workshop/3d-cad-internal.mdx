**Semester**: Spring 2025

Number of Participants: 10

Premise of the workshop
- Went over introduction of mechanical CAD (onshape), went through simple sketches and features, final product was a sample part and assembly.

What went well
- Engagement, generally good feed back.

What would you change
- Implement more demonstrations for what I am explaining; doing some demos of sketches and features would give participants a lot better idea of what I'm talking about in the slides, and probably gives them a easier time to work through their own practice parts. Also, may give more time for me to talk about more complex things.
