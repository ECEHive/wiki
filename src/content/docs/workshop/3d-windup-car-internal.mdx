**Semester**: Spring 2025

**Peer Instructors**: Elias Black

Number of Participants: 10
- The number of participants was just the right amount, as the space upstairs fit everyone, the volunteer PIs were able to spread out and help effectively, and the materials that had to be 3D printed for the lab were manageable for 10 people.

Premise of the workshop
- They learned about 3D printing, gear ratios, and how wind up toy cars worked in a lecture, and then got to assemble 3D printed wind up toy cars from model frames.

What went well
- The workshop and overall assembly of the cars went well, although the model I printed was an older model and one car had trouble being assembled due to it warping during 3D printing. Other than that, everything was able to be assembled correctly, and all the wind up toy cars worked!

What would you change
- I needed to practice and put together my slides a bit more in advance, and have a better flow when explaining. I also needed to brush up on my knowledge a bit more before the workshop, as there were some questions I had to look up and double check.
