## Premise
Create your own mini wire bonsai trees using the Hive's crafts supplies. You'll be bending jewelry wire into intricate bonsai trees. This is a great way to destress from exams and gain a new piece of desk decor.

## Logistics
Capacity: 15-20

Volunteers requested: 2 volunteers, no prerequisite skills required besides having opposable thumbs that can handle pliers

Location: 3rd floor, round tables

Editable slides:

If there's any good jewelry wire in the Hive already then there's no need to order more. Regular needle nose pliers also work but they won't turn out as nice. Also plan on using wire cutters.

## Post-Workshop Notes

Number of Participants: 12 signed up, I believe 8 of those showed up, then we had 2-3 walk-ins that I let join in.
- Number was good for my first workshop, it might've been more helpful if volunteers had constructed a tree beforehand.

Premise of the workshop
- Participant used our jewelry crafts material to bend wire into a wire bonsai tree. Started by selecting the number of wires and cutting them to desired lengths. A power drill was used to twist the wire around to form the roots around the stone base. Jewelry pliers were used to bend the branches.

What went well
- Participants were very involved and enthusiastic. Pretty much everyone left with a finished product. Overall, the environment was really chill, jokes were cracked, and connections were formed.

What would you change
- Many with limited crafts experience struggled with starting out and understanding the how to make the branches. It's also a repetitive and time-consuming craft. People also worked at different paces, some had the roots twisted while others were still cutting wire, but I don't think this was a lack of equipment issue. Next time I'd probably standardize more things, such as pre-cutting the wire.
