## Notes

Number of Participants: 12
- It was a good amount, though we had three hosts. If it's just one person running it, 10 people might be better

Premise of the workshop
- Participants used Adobe Illustrator to create designs that would be laser cut on rubber mats. The mats were then glued on wood blocks that were cut in the machine shop. The final product was a custom-design rubber stamp that could be used along with the ink pad that we gave to each participant

What went well
- The stamps turned out great! A lot of people got to see how our laser cutters work and got to use machine shop tools, which was great! People also had awesome designs that they found online or had previously designed by themselves.

What would you change
- Try to get through the presentation and design portion as quickly as possible to get people to laser cut earlier in the workshop - that took the longest part and we ended up going a while over time. Maybe get one workshop host to start laser cutting as others are still finishing up the designs.
