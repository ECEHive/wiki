## Notes
Number of Participants: 20
- It was a good number for an accessible workshop. It maximizes most of the space.
- Learned the basics of the electromagnetic forces that make a speaker work. They made a speaker using magnets, paper, bowls, and wire

Premise of the workshop
- Learn about the mechanisms behind and build a working speaker out of common household materials.
- Learned the basics of the electromagnetic forces that make a speaker work. They made a speaker using magnets, paper, bowls, and wire


What went well
- Most people were able to get a working product at the end.
- Almost everyone finished it despite not being shown the final solution! There was some frustration at first since they weren't given specific instructions, but they were really excited once they figured it out! We also used the audio amplifier from behind front desk to let participants play music through their speaker, which was probably the most rewarding thing for them.

What would you change
- I would edit the slides a bit.
