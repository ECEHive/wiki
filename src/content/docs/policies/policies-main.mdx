Rules and Policies

## Purpose of this Document

This document serves as the official collection of the rules and policies of the Interdisciplinary Design Commons (herein referred to as “The IDC,” “The Hive Makerspace,” “The Hive,” or simply, “the space”) to be adhered to by all who enter the space. These apply in addition to Georgia Tech’s official [legal](https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/legal) and [campus use](https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/campus-use-facilities) policies. This document may be modified at any time at the discretion of The Hive Staff and The Hive Executive Board.

The manner of election shall be determined by Staff, and the election as a whole shall be managed by Staff. Staff may participate in Executive Board activities, such as meetings, but are not part of the board. Executive Board members need not be active Peer Instructors while serving their term but shall have all privileges of an active Peer Instructor. The Director and Assistant Director may, at their discretion, appoint additional members to the board in any existing or new position. Appointed members need not be elected.</dd>

If a PI requires a timeline extension or an exception to this policy, they should message Staff. Shifts that are missed due to illness or urgent circumstances are excused, do not need to be made up, and are not required to be dropped or traded 24 hours in advance.

### 4.3. PI Privileges and After-Hours Use

<dl>

    <dd class="pol-1">PIs are strictly prohibited from lending their BuzzCard to anyone else, including another PI, for the purposes of getting into the space or using equipment in the space. Violation of this policy will result in a Level 3 infraction and disciplinary action up to being terminated as a PI.</dd>
    <dt class="pol-1">4.3.2.</dt>
    <dd class="pol-1">PIs are strictly prohibited from letting non-PIs into the space after hours without actively supervising them while being in the space. Another PI being in the space does not absolve one from violating this policy. PIs are allowed to have any number of guests in the space after hours so long as they are always under that PIs supervision. These guests must sign into SUMS. Supervision means being in the same room as all guests and ensuring they follow all policies of end users. Taking a short bathroom or water break is allowed without violating this policy, so long as the PI does not leave the building and so long as guests are not actively using any machinery during the break. Violation of this policy will result in a Level 3 infraction and disciplinary action up to being terminated as a PI.</dd>
    <dt class="pol-1">4.3.3.</dt>
    <dd class="pol-1">PIs may not have other student organizations as their guests.</dd>
    <dt class="pol-1">4.3.4.</dt>
    <dd class="pol-1">PIs are allowed to check out certain items from behind the front desk and take them outside of the space for a period of 2 weeks so long as they fill out the item check out form. Despite this timeframe, items must be returnedanytime at the request of Staff and must be returned before closing day. Check outs may be renewed by filling out the item return form and re- checking out the item so long as the item in question is not being held from further checkout (Staff will communicate such items on a case-by-case basis). Items that may be checked out by PIs are marked in the inventory spreadsheet.</dd>
    <dt class="pol-1">4.3.5.</dt>
    <dd class="pol-1">PIs are allowed to queue 3D prints at the front of the queues after hours so long as all of the following are true: an active print is not being stopped, the print will finish before The Hive opens, another PIs print is not being passed in the queue, all time and material limits are being followed, all proper print procedures are being followed.</dd>
    <dt class="pol-1">4.3.6.</dt>
    <dd class="pol-1">PIs are allowed to exceed the time limit for personal laser cuts after hours, so long as they are not preventing another PI from using a laser.</dd>

## 5. Infractions and Disciplinary Action

<dl>
    <dt class="pol-1">5.1.</dt>
    <dd class="pol-1">Violations of any of the policies in this document may result in infractions and disciplinary action.
