Hello! Glad you're interested in contributing. This wiki is maintained by student volunteers at the Hive Makerspace. If you are not a student volunteer, you may still contribute if you wish, however content will be thoroughly reviewed before it is published.

For any editing help or guidance, contact the current webmaster Amanda Wang over Slack.

## Getting Started
Coming soon...

## To-Dos

### Content
- All pages need to be updated content-wise
- Port over resources hosted on Sharepoint or GDrive
- On intro page, change tech area bullet list links to tiles
- Add currently hidden guides to sidebar
- Use Starlight's built-in 'steps' component for tutorials

### Implementing Features / Components

| Item | Priority | Why + Notes | Resources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-sidebars | (1) Low | Depending if you are an end user or a peer instructor, show different set of pages (maybe a toggle in top toolbar) | Guide: https://starlight-examples.netlify.app/examples/multi-sidebar/ |
| Button toggle light/dark theme | (1) Low | More convenient than a dropdown | See freeCodeCamp's "Contribute" website repo |
| Ability to display pages as as sub-items | (0) Unsure | May help with page organization. Similar to gitbook and notion |  |
| Heading link icon click to copy behavior | (1) Low | Nice-to-have QoL |  |
| Sidebar manual ordering of pages | (1) Low | Prioritizing authoring pages first. Holding back on it until we have pages. |  |
| YouTube playlist component | (2) Medium | Would make editing easier by pasting the playlist link rather than individual videos. |  |
| Carousel item with captions | (2) Medium | For workshop documentation. Navigate through figures. |  |
| Category related links templates | (1) Low | Reusable template at bottom of page, like a Wikipedia page. Helps with navigation. |  |
| Toggle collapsable dropdown component | (2) Medium | Another thing that could help with documentation |  |



## How to write guides and references

Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.
