3D printing is the process of creating a three-dimensional object from a digital file.
This is done by adding material layer by layer until the object is complete.
3D printing is also known as additive manufacturing, as it adds material to create an object.
3D printing is a great way to create prototypes, functional parts, and artistic pieces.
