Ever wanted to create your own stickers or embroider material? Look no further. The Hive has a vinyl cutter and embroidery/sewing machine to help with any of your designs. This crafting area is located by the benchtop desks, right by the staircase that leads to the bottom floor.

## Vinyl Cutter

The Hive currently has three vinyl cutters: Silhouette Cameo 3, Silhouette Cameo 4, and Silhouette Cameo 5. This machine uses the computer located right next to it, and the application to use this device is called [Silhouette Studio](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/silhouette-studio), which is very similar to Illustrator. We have anything from vinyl to cardstock and stencils for anything you want to cut with good precision.

## Sewing/Embroidery

:::caution[Maintenance Note]
At the moment, we do not have any available embroidery machines for end user usage. Our two existing machines -- BROTHER CS6000i COMPUTER and Janome Memory Craft 9850 Special Edition -- are not in operation.

However, if you're around the space, you might see a the Melco EMT16X being set up! More information to come.
:::

You don't really need to know how to sew or embroider, as most of the process is actually computerized! We have various colors of thread for you to use and test shirts for you to practice your designs before you try it on your own material.


## Dye Sublimation

For sublimation, we have the Sawgrass SG 500 and Stahl's Hotronix Thermal Transfer Press.
