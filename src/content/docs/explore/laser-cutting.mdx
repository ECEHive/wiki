We have two laser cutters made by Universal Laser Systems Inc., which are located in the production studio on the first floor of the IDC. You can see them through the outside windows at the IDC's ground entrance. Our laser cutters can cut and engrave a variety of materials, including wood, acrylic, paper, cardboard, and in some cases, metal. If you would like to learn how to use the laser cutter, ask a PI to show you. If you already know how to use the laser cutter, stop by the IDC during open hours to use it. Remember that it may be different than the one you're used to, so don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.

Recently, we have acquired a new laser cutter called the Fablight 4500. This laser cutter is a noncontinuous fiber laser capable of cutting through quarter inch steel very quickly. It was obtained to replace the plasma cutter. The cuts are cleaner and can also engrave various metals such as mild/stainless steel, anodized/not anodized aluminum, brass, and copper. The fiber laser cutter is very easy to use and instructions and more information can be found here: [Fablight Page](/hive-wiki/guides/laser-fablight/).

We have a couple pages of information for you to browse if you need it. These documents are written as if the person reading it is a Peer Instructor, but that in no way means that only Peer Instructors can browse it (:

- For our full Standard Operating Procedure that tells you how to use the Laser Cutter and the process of getting trained. Note that only Peer instructors have access to the machines.

We also have video tutorials if you don't want to sift through the SOP or documents. The video tutorials will cover all the basics of the laser cutter, the documents have more niche topics that you may not be interested in. You can find the video tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaHV-4SxpcHyQ8y1_MtftLU1UMYcQMnss).

Quick FAQ about the CO2:

- Both of our Laser cutters are Carbon dioxide lasers but are able to cut through most materials with the exception of metal (it can etch the metal!)
- The Laser cutter's bed is 32 inches by 18 inches, should you have something bigger, you can cut it down in the machine shop
- We have a rotary attachment to allow you to cut on curved surfaces
- While the laser cutter can accept any files that can be sent to a normal printer, vector format types work best
- Spots on the laser cutter come on a first come first serve basis with some exceptions, we're usually busier in the afternoons and evenings
- We do provide materials to some degree, but you are encouraged to bring your own, for most of the material we give is scrap from previous projects.
