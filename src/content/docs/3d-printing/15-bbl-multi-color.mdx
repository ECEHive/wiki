We offer a Bambu Lab P1S equipped with 4 AMS units for multi-color printing.
This allows for up to 16 different colors to be utilized in a single print.

## Materials and Specifications

For specifications of the Bambu Lab P1S, please refer to the [Bambu Lab P1S page](/3d-printing/10-bbl-p1s).
Our AMS-enabled printer is loaded with all of our available PLA colors.

## Model Design

Our slicer, Orca Slicer, offers tools that allow any model to be printed in multiple colors through a process called painting.
With that being said, painting a model can be a tedious process.
When possible, using models that are designed for multi-color printing is recommended.

## Important Considerations

**Time**:
Printing in multiple colors will take longer than printing in a single color.
This is due to the fact that the printer has to pause and switch out the filament for each color.
This can add significant time to the print.

**Waste**:
The printer will produce a lot of wasted filament.
This happens due to a process called purging.
While we have attempted to optimize our configurations to reduce the amount of purged filament,
if you are waste-conscious, you may want to consider single-color alternatives.

## Alternatives

**Painting**:
Most models can be easily printed in a single color and then painted afterward.
This is a great option if you are looking to save time, waste, or if you are looking for a specific color that is not available in filament form.
We recommend printing the model in white, as this will allow for the best color representation.
