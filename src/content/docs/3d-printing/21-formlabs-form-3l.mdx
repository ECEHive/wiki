The Formlabs Form 3L is a large-format SLA printer that is great for high-resolution prints.
While it is capable of printing in a variety of resins, we currently only offer Draft Resin.
This resin is great for prototyping and functional parts, but is not as strong as other resins.

SLA (Stereolithography) printers use a laser to cure a liquid resin into solid parts.
This allows for high-resolution prints with great detail.
Prints that are made with SLA printers require a post-processing step to remove excess resin and cure the part.
