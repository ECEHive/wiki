The Formlabs Form 3 is a high-resolution SLA printer that is great for detailed prints.

SLA (Stereolithography) printers use a laser to cure a liquid resin into solid parts.
This allows for high-resolution prints with great detail.
Prints that are made with SLA printers require a post-processing step to remove excess resin and cure the part.
