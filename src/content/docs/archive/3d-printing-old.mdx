The Hive currently has 12 3D printers: You can click on any hyperlink to learn about each specific printer. It links to their SOP! Printing at the hive is free, and is located in the Semi clean room. You can walk down and find a PI if you have something you would like to print. We only accept STL files and no gcode files since the PI's need to check each print. The printing system works by queue, and each printer may have a different queue. If you're not sure which printer you want to use, ask a PI! 

- 3 [Stratasys F170](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/HiveMakerspace/Ef7iyiLm_GVDp-9IKzhD9pMBvry161uWPPmIvquWYvmKFA?e=2GyH4b)
    - The F170 printers are dual head FDM printers extruding in Hard plastic ABS and dissolvable support material
- 4 [Ultimaker 3s Printers](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/HiveMakerspace/EQB_pfv2h5ZJq3Uc8NsnL6MBlJfJ2CFfugPA75lm8akXlw?e=WeQ1sQ)
    - Our ultimaker printers allow our users to print in up to two materials. They are also FDM printers. These machines typically are loaded with PLA and Breakaway material.
- 1 [Markforged MarkTwo](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/HiveMakerspace/EVKBTObQTX1NvCcuv44NsoEBBZpRPr3lrXltXi_1dKbkag?e=FUuhQx)
    - The MarkTwo is a specialty 3D printer that prints high strength parts using nylon-based material with fiber reinforcements such as carbon fiber.
- 4 [Formlabs Form 3 and 3L](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/HiveMakerspace/Ef2e_5JlTxVKrTe6SbPqZA8Bd9ddg5UHqb-Qg2FrPMrVMg?e=5z0uc4)
    - These SLA printers specialize in high detail and surface finish using SLA Technology. We carry multiple resins at any given time. You can stop by and check which ones we have. Normally, they are Grey, White, Draft V2, and flexible. We have 3 Form 3's and one Form 3L.

In addition to written and guided SOP's, we have a video series here that you can look at if you're a more visual learner. The videos are quick but may not be as informative.
