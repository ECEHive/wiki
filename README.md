## Guides and Reference

Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.

## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   │   └── config.ts
│   └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
